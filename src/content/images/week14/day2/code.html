  <p>Today's topic is how to improve model performance by combining multiple modes.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="B.JPG" alt="">
  <p>We will first introduce the multimodal foundations and then center around CLIP, which is the most famous vision-language model. Finally, we will have a short discussion. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="C.JPG" alt="">
  <p>We live in a multimodal world, and our brains naturally learn to process multi-sense signals received from the environment to help us make sense of the world around us. More specifically, vision is a large portion of how humans perceive, while language is a large portion of how humans communicate. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="D.JPG" alt="">
  <p>When we talk about vision-language, there are two types of categories, one is how can we produce visual data, and another is how can we consume visual information.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="E.JPG" alt="">
  <p>For visual generation, popular models include GAN and diffusion models. What makes it multi-modal is that we can use other modalities to control the image we want to generate, for example, the text-to-image methods that can use text-conditioned visual generation, such as stable diffusion. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="F.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Another approach focuses on visual understanding, which studies how can we consume the visual information from the image, and further, how can we consume the audio, image, and different modalities from our surrounding environment.</p>

  <p>Brockman, who is one of the founders of OpenAI, showed ChatGPT a diagram of my joke website, which he sketched with a pencil. Then, ChatGPT can write a functional website, this is quite remarkable as you can start to plug images into the language models</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="H.JPG" alt="">
  <p>When we see the text "Sunshine, Sunny beach, Coconut, Straw hat", we can visualize a picture of a beach with these components. This is because our mind not only receives multimodal information but also somehow aligns these modalities. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="I.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Now we move to the detailed algorithm of vision-language models. There are  particular vision-language problem spaces or representative tasks, that these models try to solve. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="J.JPG" alt="">
  <p>The first question is how to train a vision-language model. We will discuss supervised pre-training and contrastive language-image pre-training, which is also known as CLIP.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="K.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Supervised learning will map an image to a discrete label that is associated with visual content. The drawback here is that we always need labeled data. However, human annotations can be expensive and labels are limited. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="L.JPG" alt="">
  <p>The supervised learning method is deployed at first. In 2021, OpenAI released Dall-E, which is a generative model that uses transformer architecture like GPT3. As of its multimodal nature, the model receives both text and image in the training process, and it can generate images from scratch based on natural language input.</p>
<p>Here is a demo picture of Dall-E. As we can see that it can combine disparate ideas to synthesize objects, even some of them are unlikely to exist in the real world. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="M.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Besides supervised learning, the other method is called CLIP. Different from Dall-E, It takes an image and text and connect them in non-generative way. 
The idea is that we can take an image, and the model can predict the text along with it. </p>
<p>For classic image classification models, they are trained to identify objects from a predefined set of categories, for example, there are about 1000 categories in the case of the ImageNet challenge. 
CLIP is trained to understand the semantics of images and text together. It is trained with a huge amount of data, 400 million images on the web and corresponding text data, and it can perform object identification in any category without re-training.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="N.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Let’s take a look at its architecture.Since CLIP was trained using a combination of image and text, the training data is a batch of (image, text) pairs.</p>
<p>On top we have labels that belong to each image, the model tokenize it, pass it to text encoder, perform linear projection, and pass it along to a contrastive embedding screen. It does the same for images. 
Then in the contrastive embedding screen, the model takes the inner product of image vector and text vector. In contrastive learning, we want to increase the values of these blue squares to 1, which are original image and text pairs, and decrease the values of the white squares, which are not the classes they belong to. To achieve this, they compute the loss of these image-text vectors and text-image vectors and do back propagation</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="O.JPG" alt="">
  <p>We now elaborate more on the loss function of this training process. We have two vectors (text, image) here, v represents the text vector, and u represents the image vector The τ here is a trainable parameter.</p>
<p>In the first text-to-image loss function, they take the cosine similarities of these two vectors, sum up all the rows in the denominator and normalized via softmax. As we can see it is an asymmetric problem, so to compute the image-to-text loss function, they sum up all the columns instead of the rows</p>
<p>After that, they compute a cross-entropy loss of these two probability distributions, sum up all the batches, and then average it out to get the final loss function.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="P.JPG" alt="">
  <p>After pre-training, the second and third step are for the object identification. We have a new dataset with different classes and want to test CLIP on it. In step 2, we need to pass these classes to the pre-trained text encoder. Instead of passing class names alone, they use a prompt template, making a sentence out of these class names. Then the model will perform the same linear projection as in the pre-training and pass it into a contrastive space </p>
<p>Then in Step 3, we can take the image we want to predict, the model will pass it into the image encoder, do linear projection, go into the contrastive embedding space and take the inner products of this image vector and all text vectors in Step 2. The final prediction output will be the one that has the highest cosine similarity.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="Q.JPG" alt="">
  <p>The authors share three main ideas behind this work.</p>
<p>The first one is the need of a sufficiently large dataset. The simple truth is that existing manually labeled datasets are just way too small (100k samples) for training a natural language supervised model on the scale of GPT. The intuition was that the required dataset already exists on the web without the need to label data manually. So they create a new dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from a variety of publicly available sources on the Internet.</p>
<p>The second  one is to select an efficient pre-training method. After experimenting with class-label prediction, the authors realized that the key to success was in predicting only which text as a whole is paired with which image, not the exact word of that text. This discovery led to the use of the loss function we introduced earlier, such that the cosine similarity for each correct pair of embeddings is maximized, and the cosine similarity of the rest of the pairings are minimized. </p>
<p>The last one is to choose and scale a model. After some experiments, they use a transformer as text encoder, and leave two options for image encoder. The image encoder is either a Vision Transformer or a modified ResNet-D with attention pooling instead of global average pooling. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="R.JPG" alt="">
  <p>After understanding the architecture of CLIP, let’s look at evaluations of this model. The figure above shows that CLIP is by far much more data-efficient than the other methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="S.JPG" alt="">
  <p>As we can see in the figure,  with prompt engineering and ensembling, models more likely to achieve higher accuracy score rather than just simply having contextless class names. </p>
<p>One observation is that CLIP performs poorly on differentiate word sense when there’s only a label without context. For example, the label crane can mean construction crane or a crane that flies. </p>
<p>Another observation is that in their pre-training dataset text, it is relatively rare to see an image with just a single word as a label. So to bridge the distribution gap, they use a prompt template. Instead of a single label, they use template sentences like “a photo of a label”. They also found customizing the prompt text to each task can further improve performance. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="T.JPG" alt="">
  <p>There’s a trend in machine learning that if you give more data and compute, then the error goes down even with the same type of models, and that seems to hold pretty much the same here. 
As we can see the error rate scales smoothly as a function of model compute. However, they do note that there are lots of variance, this curve is the average. For individual datasets, it varies widely. 
It may be due to how the dataset is selected, how the prompt is engineered, still lots of unknown</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="U.JPG" alt="">
  <p>For the evaluation in terms of performance, CLIP is compared with a linear probe on ResNet50. It is pretty impressive that the zero-shot CLIP outperform a fully trained model on many of the dataset, including ImageNet.</p>
<p>On the other side, CLIP is weak on several specialized, complex, or abstract tasks such as EuroSAT (satellite image classification), KITTI Distance (recognizing distance to the nearest car). This may because these are not the kind of text and image we found on the Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="V.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Here we compare zero-shot CLIP with few-shot linear probes, This is where pre-training really comes in, as the model only see few examples per class.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, a zero-shot CLIP is comparable to a 16-shot BiT-M model, which is one of the best models in the public that’s doing transfer learning in computer vision.
If we linear probe the CLIP model, then it way outperform these other linear probe models.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="W.JPG" alt="">
  <p>They also evaluate CLIP in terms of its robustness to perturbations. Here they compare zero-shot CLIP to models that have been trained on imagenet, finding that zero-shot clip matches the performance of resnet101. As this classifier degrades as we go for harder and harder datasets overall, CLIP is more robust. This sort of implies that representation in CLIP should be nuanced enough, so it can pick up on different features than only distinguishing banana from other classes in the Imagenet dataset. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="X.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Here, they customize zero-shot CLIP to each dataset (adapt to class shift in purple) based on class names. While this supervised adaptation to class shift increases ImageNet accuracy by around 10 percent, it slightly reduces the average robustness. From the right side, the improvements are concentrated on only a few datasets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when they adapt CLIP to fully supervised logistic regression classifiers on the best CLIP model’s features, it comes close to the standard Imagenet training in terms of robustness. Thus, it seems that the representation itself in zero-shot CLIP has more value, such that they are more stable and nuanced.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="XXX.JPG" alt="">
  <p>There are various works following CLIP based on this contrastive learning structure. The first extension is to further scale up texts and images. The second is to design better models.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="XXXX.JPG" alt="">
  <p>In CVPR 2023, there’s a reproducible scaling laws paper, Basically they used the open larges scale LAION-2B dataset to pre-train openclip across different scales. </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="XXXXX.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Another paper talked about how should we scale data? Should we scale it up with noisier and noisier data? </p>
<p>Their focus is to search the next-generation image-text datasets. Instead of fixing the dataset and designing different algorithms, the authors propose to fix the CLIP training method but select the datasets instead. With this method, they come up with a high-quality large-scale dataset.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="XXXXXX.JPG" alt="">
  <p>For the model improvement, FLIP is proposed to scale CLIP training via masking. It randomly masks out image patches with a high masking ratio, and only encodes the visible patches. It turns out this method does not hurt performance but improves training efficiency </p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="XXXXXXX.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Another line of work focuses on improving the language side model design of CLIP. The model K-Lite utilizes the Wiki definition of entities together with the original alt-text for contrastive pre-training. Such knowledge is useful for a variety of domains and datasets, making it possible to build a generic approach for task-level transfer.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="XXXXXXXX.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Recall that in this motivated example, we argue that more modalities will enhance the learning process.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="XXXXXXXXX.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Imagebind tries to utilize more modalities to improve performance. However, one challenge here is that not all generated data are naturally aligned due to the lack of a corresponding relationship in the training set.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="XXXXXXXXXX.JPG" alt="">
  <p>For Imagebind,  there are different modalities include image, text, video, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU, which contains the accelerator, and gyroscope data. The goal of imagebind is to learn a single joint embedding space for all the modalities, and then use image as the binding modality. Here I denotes image modality, and M denotes all the other modalities. They use deep neural networks as encoders to extract embeddings from each of the modalities, so each modality has it own encoder, just like the clip.</p>
<p>During the training, the image and text modality was kept frozen, and the weights of other modalities were updated, and this freezing shows the alignment to emerge between other modalities for which we don’t have any natural alignment, for example, between audio, and depth. </p>
<p>The preprocessed inputs are passed through encoders and then passed through a simple linear layer to make sure they are of same dimension before being trained with the loss called infoNCE loss. This loss is a modified cross-entropy loss, which extends the contrastive learning to multiple modalities. Let the output for image be q, and the output for other modalities be k. The loss here tries to align image modality with all other modalities.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="Y.JPG" alt="">
  
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="YY.JPG" alt="">
  <p>They study
whether Imagebind's embeddings can be used to compose
information across modalities. The above figure shows
image retrievals obtained by adding together image and audio
embeddings. The joint embedding space allows for us to
compose two embeddings: e.g., image of fruits on a table +
sound of chirping birds and retrieve an image that contains
both these concepts, i.e., fruits on trees with birds. Such
emergent compositionality whereby semantic content from
different modalities can be composed will likely enable a
rich variety of compositional tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="YYY.JPG" alt="">
  <p>By utilizing the audio embedding of Imagebind, it is possible to design an audio-based detector that can detect and segment objects based on audio prompts.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="YYYY.JPG" alt="">
  <p>As proposed in CLIP, replacing labels with textual descriptions and using a text encoder to encode them can feasibly convert closed-set problems to open-set ones. A number of works have been proposed to transform different computer vision tasks by replacing the label space with language space.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="Z.JPG" alt="">
  <p>For the first question, we believe there are several differences between humans and machines for cognition. Although these models will outperform humans on several specific tasks, they also have limitations. For example, humans will perceive an image as a whole, but machines perceive it pixel by pixel. This ensures humans are good at using context to interpret images and text. While these models can recognize patterns and correlations between words and images, they may not fully grasp the broader context as humans do. </p>
<p>For the second question, the presenter gave an example that there is a specific food in Wuhan called "hot dry noodles". When we give a picture of this kind of noodles with the caption "hot dry noodles in Wuhan", the multi-mode models will output how this food is popular in Wuhan. However, if we replace the caption as "hot dry noodles in Shandong", the model will still describe this noodles in Wuhan instead of Shandong. The presenter believes this is an example of bias because a lot of data on this noodles is associated with Wuhan. Thus, even though the caption of the image is changed, the model can not comprehend because the representation is fixed.</p>
