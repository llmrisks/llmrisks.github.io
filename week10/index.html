<h2 id="question-would-more-models-help">Question: Would more models help?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve discussed so many risks and issues of GenAI so far and one question is that it can be difficult for us to come up with a possible solution to these problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would &ldquo;<em>Using a larger model to verify a smaller model&rsquo;s hallucinations</em>&rdquo; a good idea?</li>
<li>One caveat would be &ldquo;<em>How can one ensure the larger model&rsquo;s accuracy?</em>&rdquo;</li>

<h2 id="question-any-potential-applications-of-llms-as-a-judge">Question: Any potential applications of LLMs as a Judge?</h2>
<p>As summarized from the Week 10 discussion channels, there could be many potential applications of LLMs as a Judge, such as accessing writing quality, checking harmful content, judging if social media post is factually correct or biased, evaluating if code is optimal.</p>
<!-- <center>

</div>
</center>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start from Paper 1:
Zheng, Lianmin, Wei-Lin Chiang, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhanghao Wu, Yonghao Zhuang, Zi Lin et al. &ldquo;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05685.pdf">Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena.</a>&rdquo; arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.05685 (2023).</p>
<p>Multi-Turn questions provide a different way to query GPT. In this paper, the authors ask multi-turn dialogues to two different assistants.</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide6.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>The paper provides two benchmarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MT-bench provides a multi-turn question set, and it challenges chatbot to do difficult questions.</li>
<li>The Chatbot Arena that provides a crowdsourced battle platform that reveals two options for human to choose.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results shows that</p>
<ul>
<li>GPT-4 is the best, which matches both controlled (MT-bench) and crowdsourced (Arena) human preferences.</li>
<li>Regardless of pair or single, it exceeds over 80% of agreement with the human subjects.</li>
</ul>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide8.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>This shows that stong LLMs can be a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences. Some advantages and disadvantages were introduced for LLM-as-a-Judge.</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalability: Human evaluation is time-consuming and expensive</li>
<li>Consistency: Human judgment varies by individuals</li>
<li>Explainability: LLMs can be trained to evaluate and provide reasons of their judgements</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Position Bias: Bias towards responses based on their position (preferring the first response)</li>
<li>Verbosity Bias: Favor longer, more verbose answers regardless of accuracy</li>
<li>Overfitting: LLMs might overfit the training data, don’t generalize to new, unseen responses</li>
</ul>

<p>The above potential of fine-tuning open-source model (there could be interpretability problems) leads to a question: &ldquo;the paper motivates wanting to be able to emulate the performance of stronger, closed-source models - <em>can we imitate these models?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="imitation-models">Imitation Models</h1>
<p>Paper 2: Gudibande, A., Wallace, E., Snell, C., Geng, X., Liu, H., Abbeel, P., Levine, S. and Song, D., 2023. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15717.pdf"><em>The false promise of imitating proprietary LLMs</em></a>. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.15717.</p>
<p>To start the second paper, let&rsquo;s do a class poll about which output people would prefer.</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide13.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>Most of the class chose Output A.</p>
<p>Here, let&rsquo;s look into the definition of model imitation:
&ldquo;<em>The premise of model imitation is that once a proprietary LM is made available via API, one can collect a dataset of API outputs and use it to fine-tune an open-source LM.</em>&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The goal of model imitation is to imitate the capablity of the proprietary LM.</p>

</div>
</center>
<p>This shows that the Broad Imitation can be more difficult than Local Imitation as Local Imitation is only for specific tasks. However, Broad Imitation requires gathering of a diverse dataset and the imitation model needs to capture that distribution to have similar output.</p>
<p>To build imitation datasets, there are two primary approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural Examples</strong>: If you have a set of inputs in mind, (e.g. tweets about a specific topic), use them to query the target model.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic Examples</strong>: Prompt the target model to iteratively generate examples from the same distribution as an initial small seed set of inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper used two curated datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Task-Specific Imitation Using Synthetic Data: <strong>NQ Synthetic</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Broad Imitation Using Natural Data: <strong>ShareGPT-Mix</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>NQ Synthetic</strong>:</p>

<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide19.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<p>For the <strong>ShareGPT-Mix</strong> dataset which includes three sources:</p>

<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide20.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p><em>Note: the paper above presents the data using frequency with too few data points, and the numbers in the table don&rsquo;t seem to make sense (e.g., no way to get 31% out of 50 queries).</em></p>
<p>Using the two datasets, the authors look into two research questions &mdash;<br>
<em>How does model imitation improve as we</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Scale the data</strong>: Increase the amount of imitation data (including fine-tuning with different sized data subsets)</li>
<li><strong>Scale the model</strong>: Vary the capabilities of the underlying base model (they used the parameters in the model used as a proxy for base-model quality, regardless of the architecture)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the experiment setup:</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide22.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>The authors use Amazon Mturk using ChatGPT versus Imitation models ($15 an hour and assume that having that will help the quality of annotations). They also used GPT-4 to evalute both.</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide23.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>For the preference evalution (Figure below):</p>
<ul>
<li>(Left graph) Over 85% of responses were prefered by the human at same rate or over at ChatGPT. However, more imitation data won&rsquo;t close the gap, as according to the x-axis.</li>
<li>(Middle graph) However, more imitation data can cause decrease of accuracy.</li>
<li>(Right graph) For the number of parameters, the larger base model leads to the better performance.
They thus concluded that rather than fine-tuning on more imitation data, the best way to improve model capabilities is still to improve the base capabilities, rather than the fine tuning process on the imitation data.</li>
</ul>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide24.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>GPT-4 findings are similar to the human preferences that more imitation data doesn&rsquo;t close the gap and a larger model will contribute to better performance.</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide25.png" alt="" width="85%">

<p>They found little improvement with increasing amount of imitation data and size of imitation LM.</p>

<ul>

<li>One risk is that experiment results can be false based on style-imitating, not reflecting its intrinsic characteristics.</li>

Should there be any legal implications for this?</h3>
<p>Most people in our class agree that there should be no legal concern for researchers and companies to reverse engineer other models via immitating. Professor also proposed another idea that tech companies like OpenAI relies heavily on public-accessible training data from the internet, which weaken the argument that companies have the right to exclusively possess the whole model.</p>

<h3 id="instruction-tuning">Instruction-tuning</h3>
<p><em>Instruction tuning</em> is a technique that allows pre-trained language models to learn from input (natural language descriptions of the task) and response pairs. The goal is to train the model to generate the correct output given a specific input and instruction.</p>
<p>{&ldquo;instruction&rdquo;: &ldquo;Arrange the words in the given sentence to form a grammatically correct sentence.&rdquo;,
&ldquo;input&rdquo;: &ldquo;the quickly brown fox jumped&rdquo;,
&ldquo;output&rdquo;: &ldquo;the brown fox jumped quick
ly&rdquo;}.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-with-existing-methods">Challenges with Existing Methods</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Model imitation is a false promise&rdquo; since &ldquo;broadly matching ChatGPT using purely imitation would require:</p>
<ol>
<li>a concerted effort to collect enormous imitation datasets</li>
<li>far more diverse and higher quality imitation data than is currently available.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Simple instructions with limited diversity: Using an initial set of prompts to incite the LFM to produce new instructions. Any low-quality or overly similar responses are then removed, and the remaining instructions are reintegrated into the task pool for further iterations.</li>
<li>Query complexity: Existing methods are limited in their ability to handle complex queries that require sophisticated reasoning. This is because they rely on simple prompts that do not capture the full complexity of the task.</li>
<li>Data scaling: Existing methods require large amounts of high-quality data to achieve good performance. However, collecting such data is often difficult and time-consuming.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-is-orca">What is Orca</h3>
<p>Orca, a 13-billion parameter model that learns to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs. Orca learns from rich signals from GPT-4, including explanation traces, step-by-step thought processes, and other complex instructions, guided by teacher assistance from ChatGPT.</p>
<h3 id="explanation-tuning">Explanation Tuning</h3>
<p>The authors augment ⟨query, response⟩ pairs with detailed responses from GPT-4 that explain the reasoning process of the teacher as it generates the response. These provide the student with additional signals for learning. They leverage system instructions (e.g.., explain like I’m five, think step-by-step and justify your response, etc.) to elicit such explanations. This is in contrast to instruction tuning, which only uses the prompt and the LFM response for learning, providing little opportunity for mimicking the LFM’s “thought” process.</p>

<p>We think that imitation models should not be more biased because base models are generally less biased given a better ptr-training data. Since there are also sufficient styles, the risk of leaning towards a specific style is also mitigated.</p>

<p>Information exists in diverse formats such as text, images, graphs, time-series data, and more. In this era of information overload, it is crucial to understand the effects of this data on language models. The research have been predominantly concentrating on examining the influences of model and data sizes.</p>

<p>We are going to look at two important research questions using two of the research papers:
(1) What types of data are beneficial to the models? – Using the research paper, LIMA: Less is more for Alignment
(2) What are the consequences of low-quality data for the models? – Using the research paper, The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget</p>
<h2 id="lima-less-is-more-for-alignment">LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment</h2>
<p>Chunting Zhou, Pengfei Liu, Puxin Xu, Srini Iyer, Jiao Sun, Yuning Mao, Xuezhe Ma, Avia Efrat, Ping Yu, Lili Yu, Susan Zhang, Gargi Ghosh, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Omer Levy. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206">LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206.pdf">pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>Superficial Alignment Hypothesis</strong> — The model learns knowledge and capabilities entirely during pre-training phase, while alignment teaches about the specific sub-distribution of formats to be used or styles to be used when interacting with the users.</p>

<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/Picture4.png" alt="Approach" width="85%">
</div>

<p>The authors curated a diverse set of training prompts, selecting 750 top questions from community forums and complementing them with 250 manually crafted examples of prompts and responses. They prioritized <em>quality</em>, <em>diversity</em>, and <em>uniformity</em> in their selection process, all while utilizing a smaller dataset. To evaluate performance, LIMA was benchmarked against state-of-the-art language models using a set of 300 challenging test prompts.</p>

<p>The left side showcases the outcomes of a human-based evaluation, comparing LIMA’s performance across various model sizes. Meanwhile, the right side employs GPT-4 for evaluation purposes. In the comparisons with the first two language models, LIMA emerges as the victor. Notably, it’s interesting to observe that LIMA secures a 19% win rate against GPT-4, even when GPT-4 itself is utilized as the evaluator.</p>

<p>They also evaluated LIMA&rsquo;s performance in terms of out-of-distribution scenarios and robustness. LIMA safely addressed 80% of the sensitive prompts presented to it. Regarding responses to out-of-distribution inputs, LIMA performed exceptionally well.</p>

<p>In the concluding series of experiments, the research team delved into how the diversity of the test data influences LIMA.</p>
<p>They observed that the filtered Stack Exchange dataset exhibited both diversity and high-quality responses. In contrast, the unfiltered Stack Exchange dataset, while diverse, lacked in quality. On the other hand, wikiHow provided high-quality responses specifically to “how to” prompts. LIMA showcased impressive performance when dealing with datasets that were both highly diverse and of high quality.</p>
<p>The authors also explored the effects of data volume, with their findings illustrated in the right figure above. Interestingly, they noted that the quantity of data did not exert any noticeable impact on the quality of the generated content.</p>

<p>This slide delves into the personal perspectives of the presenter on drawing parallels between Large Language Models (LLMs) and students, as well as evaluating the influence of LIMA on a student’s learning journey.
The take-away message from the first paper was that quality and diversity of the data is more important for LLM than the quantity of the data.</p>

<p>This paper discusses about model collapse, which is a degenerative process where the model no longer remembers the underlying true distribution. This mainly happens with data where the probability of occurrence is low.</p>

<h2 id="causes-for-model-collapse">Causes for model collapse</h2>
<p>The two main causes for the model collapse are: (i) Statistical approximation error that occurs as the number of samples are finite, and (ii) Functional approximation error that occurs due to the function approximators being not expressive enough.</p>

</center>
<p>Here, the model collapse is expressed through mathematical terms, providing a comprehensive overview of the feedback mechanism involved in the learning process.</p>
<p>Initially, the data are presumed to be meticulously curated by humans, ensuring a pristine starting point. Following this, Model 0 undergoes training, and subsequently, data are sampled from it. At stage n in the process, the data collected from step n - 1 are incorporated into the overall dataset. This comprehensive dataset is then utilized to train Model n.</p>
<p>Ideally, when Monte Carlo sampling is employed to obtain data, the resultant dataset should statistically align closely with the original, assuming that the fitting and sampling procedures are executed flawlessly. This entire procedure mirrors the real-world scenario witnessed on the Internet, where data generated by models become increasingly prevalent and integrated into subsequent learning and development cycles. This creates a continuous feedback loop, where model-generated data are perpetually fed back into the system, influencing future iterations and their capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-analysis">Theoretical Analysis</h2>
<p>The following four slides delve into a theoretical analysis of both discrete and continuous distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Discrete Distribution:</strong>
In scenarios where a discrete distribution is under consideration, events with low probabilities tend to degenerate when the sample size is finite. As the number of time steps advances towards infinity, the distribution converges towards a delta distribution. This phenomenon results in the preservation of only the events with high probabilities, while those less likely start to fade away.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Distribution:</strong>
Assuming the initial distribution to be a Gaussian distribution, the distribution of Xji is analyzed. The resulting distribution follows a variance-gamma distribution, showcasing a divergence from the initial Gaussian form. When Mi = M, the variance’s difference exhibits a linear growth with respect to n. This indicates that as we proceed through time steps or iterations, the divergence from the initial distribution becomes more pronounced. To quantify the exact extent of divergence between distributions, the Wasserstein-2 distance is employed. This measure provides a precise way to understand how far apart the distributions have moved from each other. The analysis reveals that in order to maintain a finite distance as indicated by the Wasserstein-2 measure, Mi must increase at a rate that is super-linear with respect to n.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> this result didn&rsquo;t make sense to anyone in the seminar. It seems to contradict the intuition (the variance should go to zero as <em>n</em> increases instead of increasing). Either something is wrong with the set up, or this is measuring something different from what we expect.</p>

<p>The following two slides provides steps to estimate mean and variance of general distributions other than one-dimensional Gaussian. They derive a lower bound on the expected value of the distance between the true distribution and the approximated distribution at step $n+1$, which represents the risk that occurs due to finite sampling.</p>
<p>The takeaway of the lower bound is that the sampling rate needs to increase superlinearly to make an accurate end distribution approximation.</p>

<p>To evaluate the performance of GMM, we can visualize the progression of GMM fitting process over time. From the figure, we can see within 50 iterations of re-sampling, the underlying distribution is mis-perceived, and the performance worsens over time.</p>

<p>As before, an autoencoder is trained on an original data source, which later will be sampled. Figure 9 on the left
shows an example of generated data. Again, over a number of generations, the representation has very little resemblance of the original classes learned from data. This implies that longer generation leads to worse quality, as much more information will be lost. We can see from Figure 8 (below) that as with single-dimensional Gaussians, tails disappear over time and all of the density shifts towards the mean.</p>

<p>To assess model collapse in Large Language Models (LLMs), given the high computational cost of training, the authors opted to fine-tune an available pre-trained open-source LLM. In this context, as the generations progress, models tend
to produce more sequences that the original model would produce with the higher likelihood.</p>
<p>This phenomenon closely resembles observations made in the context of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), where over successive generations, models begin to produce samples that are more likely according to the original model&rsquo;s probabilities.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the generated data exhibits significantly longer tails, indicating that certain data points are generated that would never have been produced by the original model. These anomalies represent errors that accumulate as a result of the generational learning process.</p>

<p>Q1.
The class discussed the purpose of generating synthetic data. It seems unnecessary to use synthetic data to train on styles, as it can be achieved easily based on the experiments. However, for more complicated tasks that involves reasoning, it might require more human-in-the-loop to validate the correctness of the synthetic data.</p>
<p>Q2.
The class discussion focuses on the significance of domain knowledge in the context of alignment tasks. When dealing with a high-quality domain-specific dataset that includes a golden standard, fine-tuning emerges as a preferable approach for alignment tasks. Conversely, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) seems to be more suitable for general use cases that aim to align with human preferences. Additionally, we explore the potential of leveraging answers obtained through chain-of-thought prompting for the purpose of fine-tuning.</p>
<p>Q3.
The tail of a distribution typically contains rare events or extreme values that occur with very low probability. These events may be outliers, anomalies, or extreme observations that are unusual compared to the majority of data points. For example, in a financial dataset, the tail might represent extreme market fluctuations, such as a stock market crash.</p>
<p>Q4.
This is an open-ended question. One possible reason is that while fine-tuning with generated data mix the original data with the generated data, this augmentation can introduce novel, synthetic examples that the model hasn&rsquo;t seen in the original data. These new examples can extend the tail of the distribution by including previously unseen rare or extreme cases.</p>

<li>
<p>There are lots of papers using LLMs to generate synthetic data for data augmentation and show improvement over multiple tasks, what do you think is an important factor when sampling synthetic data generated from LLMs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493">The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget</a>, the authors discuss how training with generation data affects the approximation for the tail of the true data distribution. Namely, for training GMM/VAEs, the tail of the true distribution will disappear in the estimated distribution (Figure 8). On the other hand, when fine-tuning large language models with generation data, the estimator will have a much longer tail (Figure 10). What do you think causes such a difference? In the real world, what does the tail of a distribution represent and how do you think this phenomenon impacts practical applications?</p>
