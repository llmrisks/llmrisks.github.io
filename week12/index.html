<p><strong>LLM agents</strong> are the &ldquo;next big thing&rdquo;, with the potential to directly impact important fields like healthcare and education. Essentially, they are LLM-based systems that have the ability to use external tools, such as Internet browsing access and calculators, to augment their abilities.</p>

<p>LLMs have limitations that can potentially be addressed with these &ldquo;tools&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Outdated information</strong>: LLMs cannot access up-to-date information without access to external sources. Giving them the ability to access realtime information (via Internet queries) would lead to better responses, such as &ldquo;who is the President of USA today?&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Hallucination</strong>: External knowledge sources can help ground generation in facts and work to supplement the model&rsquo;s knowledge, reducing the possibility of hallucinating.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of mathematical skills</strong>: Access to a calculator can help model generate correct responses and computations involving math. Using zero-shot learning can help reduce hallucination, but providing access to a calculator (assuming it is used correctly) can guarantee correct responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other limitations include limited multi-language usability, having no concept of “time”, etc.</p>

<p>The main idea is to develop a system that has the ability to use external tools (translation, calendar, search engine, etc.).
The key lies in knowing <em>when</em> to use a tool, <em>which</em> tool to use, and <em>how</em> to use it. Training is self-supervised, unlike other capability-enhancing techniques like RLHF.</p>

<p>Key step: generating candidate API calls via in-context learning. The method starts with examples generated by humans, e.g. in-context examples for “Coca-Cola”, etc.</p>

<p>$k$ positions are sampled at random from the text to serve as &ldquo;candidates&rdquo; for adding <code>&lt;API&gt;</code> tags.</p>

  <td colspan=1 align="center"><b></b></td>

<p>Tokens up to the position with an “<API>” tag are provided to get $m$ candidate API calls.</p>

</tr>
  <td colspan=1 align="center"><b></b></td>
</table>
<p>An additional weighted loss term is introduced, corresponding to the utility of information added after using candidate API calls. This loss term is meant to provide feedback for which API calls were useful for some given context.</p>
<table><tr>
  <td><img src="../images/week12/day1/LLM_Agents_MondayPres_Page_16.jpg" width="95%"></td>
</tr>
  <td colspan=1 align="center"><b></b></td>
</table>
<p>Given the loss term and general strategy for inserting <code>&lt;API&gt;</code> tokens, the model is fine-tuned with the augmented dataset. At prediction time, the model uses a variant of greedy decoding, making API calls if the <code>&lt;API&gt;</code> tag is in the top-k predictions at any token position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Evans talked about how the method could benefit from having some “feedback” from the API’s quality of response, and not having an implicit bias in the design that considers API calls as “costly”.</p>

<p>Interestingly, performance for some cases (ASDiv, Table 4) is better for the version with disabled API calls (so no agent-like behavior) than the variant equipped with API-returned information.</p>

<li>For small model sizes, performance does not change much with the inclusion of external knowledge.</li>
<li>The utility of API calls is clearer for larger models, where performance drops significantly when API calls are disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of limitations, these tools cannot be used “in chain” (an in iterative-refinement approach, where multiple API calls are made) and require sampling a lot of data.</p>

<p>Learning based on fine-tuning and prompting (ReACT prompting strategy, uses reasoning &amp; action steps together as prompt).

<p>Without feedback, planning may proceed via single reasoning (dependent, connected steps), multi-path reasoning (tree-like structure, kind-of approximates human thinking?), or using external planners (using domain-specific planners).</p>
<p>Similarly, planning with feedback may rely on information from humans (e.g. RLHF), environmental feedback (e.g. RL for game simulation), or model feedback (using other pre-trained models).</p>

<li>Agents can have different targets: task completion, communication (communicate with other agents/humans), or exploration (explore vs. exploit tradeoff).</li>

<li>Their exploration space may include API calls, or internal knowledge.</li>

<p>Performance seems pretty good with GPT-4 (Left, ~35%) but when names are obfuscated (Right), plan generation results drop to 0-2%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Evans talked about how the benchmarks are not a comparison with human performance, which would also understandably go down when names are obfuscated. It is thus unclear whether these drops in performance are expected (given that humans are bad at the modified task as well), or a result of the model not really &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; how to solve the given task. An alternate explanation for these results, would just be that the model has a hard time identifying entities that are labeled with non-sensical, multi-token strings that don&rsquo;t revaal them to be blocks. That said, there is tons of data about Blocksworld in the training data, so a difficult domain to test what the model is really learning (if anything).</p>

<li><em>What are your thoughts on LLM reasonig/planning?</em> We talked how in psychology, reasoning is divided into 3 domains (knowledge acquisition, reasoning, decision making). Even for the literature in this field, it is unclear how these three domains interact with each other, and thus even more complicated for LLMs.</li>
<li><em>How should we proceed with this line of research?</em> We acknowledged how it is difficult to define “planning” for both humans, and even more so for LLMs. Professor Evans mentioned that for this line of work to advance, we need to come up with a good benchmark (but this is very labor-intensive). Students recalled work on performing activities in Minecraft as a useful benchmark for planning and agents. The “granularity” of planning is much more nuanced - humans can infer steps in between (or use domain knowledge), but harder if talking about agents or &ldquo;just LLMs&rdquo;. At the same time, we do not have a good answer for &ldquo;should we expect our model to behave more like a hard-coded program or like a human (performance changes due to new factors, ex. Semantic changes, etc)?&rdquo;</li>

<p>The experimental setup comprises two restaurants, serving as competitive agents, and fourteen customers, acting as judge agents. To confine the action space of the Large Language Model (LLM), a management system is employed. This system functions as a question provider, formulating precise inquiries for the LLM to ensure that its output remains within the defined action space. The customers exercise their judgment when evaluating offers from both restaurants, ultimately selecting based on their individual constraints and requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion Notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>LLM scores can act as a baseline, but there is always a possibility of bias. For instance, changing the order of options presented to the model may sometimes result in a different score being outputted.</li>
<li>Designing a model based solely off of customer/restaurant data fails to capture other experiences of dining (i.e. customer service, environment/ambience, etc.) and thus indicates the simulation’s low fidelity. Capturing decision-making factors in customers is especially difficult, as they are difficult to define and quantify. The current simulation does not account for customers’ risk-aversion for trying new dishes, and it also does not consider the influence of star ratings or reviews on customers’ decisions to choose between the two restaurants. There may also be issues with prompt-based tasks, such as over-generalization.</li>
<li>Utilizing simulations has the potential for real-world social trends and phenomena to be reproduced without requiring a large number of real people or complex variables; it is not necessary to recreate an entire town in order to gain insights into real-world trends.</li>

<p>Agents are able to learn from each other while maintaining differentiation. This is visible in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agents <strong>imitate</strong> observed strategies that provide a high reward. For example, a restaurant may copy the popular dishes of another restaurant to compete for their clinetele.</li>
<li>Conversely, <strong>differentiation</strong> is used to attract patrons that the competing agents don&rsquo;t specifically cater to; one restaurant may provide inexpensive food for customers on a budget while another provides fine-dining options.</li>

<p><strong>Employing Negotiation-Based Tasks and Games:</strong> In the context of collaborative endeavors, employing negotiation-based tasks and games is a valuable strategy. These involve the participation of diverse agents, such as a managerial figure, a chef, and a waiter, each representing distinct stakeholders. The amalgamation of their inputs contributes to a holistic decision-making process.</p>
<p><strong>The Feasibility of Restaurant Collaboration:</strong> We explored the possibility of restaurants engaging in collaborative efforts, including the exchange of information regarding signature dishes, the potential collusion to elevate pricing structures collectively, and the coordination of operational hours. However, it is essential to consider potential drawbacks, particularly the willingness of competitors to engage in such cooperative ventures.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limitations of having collaborative approach: bias in one agent might cascade into bias in multiple agents.</li>
<li>Discussed negotiation-based tasks and negotiation games to collaborate with each other. For instance, one could have an ensemble of different agents (i.e. manager agent makes final decision, chef has a say, waiter has a say, etc.)
Each agent represents different stakeholder</li>
<li>Discussed how restaurants could collaborate together, e.g. communicate signature dishes, collude to raise prices of everything, coordinate times they are open. Noted potential downsides, including willingess to collaborate and power dynamics between agents.</li>

<p>LTC Communication Patters:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Monologue:</strong> Letting an agent train by providing feedback to itself. The agent will play the role of the actor and the instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Dialogue:</strong> As opposed to the previous approach, training is conducted with separate agents acting as the actor and the instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Analogue:</strong> Similar to the former approach, but raining rewards and examples are provided by the instructor agent rather than by the environment.</li>

<p>The agent model is optimized with the trajectory data collected in the exploration phase. This relies on a multi-objective loss function composed of a standard loss function for unsupervised language model training and a reinforcement objective to maximize the expected reward from previous communication data. Beta acts as a balancing hyper-parameter.</p>

<ol>
<li>What are the key methodologies or techniques used in the Toolformer paper, and how does the tool use of LLM differ from the existing use of LLM, e.g., prompting, demonstration, etc.?</li>
<li>Which potential applications or industries could benefit (or suffer) the most from the LLM Agent concept? How might it revolutionize or impact these areas?</li>
<li>Regarding <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/276268-can-llms-really-reason-and-plan/fulltext">Can LLMs Really Reason and Plan?</a>, do you agree with the opinion that what LLMs really do is a form of universal approximate retrieval, which was sometimes mistakenly interpreted as reasoning capabilities? What is your perspective on this question?</li>

<p><strong>(Post response by Tuesday, 14 November)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17512">CompeteAI: Understanding the Competition Behaviors in Large Language Model-based Agents</a> paper shows that LLM agents can be used for simulating the competition environment. How might the competition behaviors observed in LLM-based agents translate to other real-world applications where strategic competition is critical? Essentially, are there specific characteristics unique to the restaurant setting that might not directly apply to other sectors?</li>
<li>What are some considerations (ethical or otherwise) that may arise as a result of programming LLMs to compete with each other, especially considering the possibility of this being implemented in real world scenarios? If there are valid concerns, how could the models be calibrated to ensure that the competition remains ethical, preventing the agents from learning and adopting potentially harmful or deceptive strategies?</li>
<li>Agents can be used in various ways. One way is to make them compete (like in the CompeteAI paper). Instead of competing, how can agents be used in other ways (e.g. by collaborating/communicating with each other), and how might this impact their behavior?</li>
<li>Given the adaptive nature of LLM-based agents in a competitive environment, how can we ensure transparency and interpretability in the decision-making processes of these agents, so that stakeholders can understand and trust the outcomes of such simulations?</li>
