      <description>The slides are here: Regulating Dangerous Technologies (I&amp;rsquo;ve included some slides in the posted slides that I didn&amp;rsquo;t present in class but you might find interesting, including some excerpts from a talk I gave in 2018 on Mutually Assured Destruction and the Impending AI Apocalypse.)
Since one of the groups made the analogy to tobacco products, I also will take the liberty of pointing to a talk I gave at Google making a similar analogy: The Dragon in the Room.</description>

Monday, November 6: Watermarking LLM Outputs Recent instances of AI-generated text passing for human text and the writing of students being misattributed to AI suggest the need for a tool to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. The presenters also noted that the increase in the amount of AI-generated text online is a risk for training future LLMs on this data.</description>

Attention, Transformers, and BERT Monday, 28 August
Transformers1 are a class of deep learning models that have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and various other domains. The concept of transformers originated as an attempt to address the limitations of traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in sequential data processing. Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of transformers&amp;rsquo; evolution and significance.
Background and Origin RNNs2 were one of the earliest models used for sequence-based tasks in machine learning.</description>

Seminar Plan The actual seminar won&amp;rsquo;t be fully planned by GPT-4, but more information on it won&amp;rsquo;t be available until later.
I&amp;rsquo;m expecting the structure and format to that combines aspects of this seminar on adversarial machine learning and this course on computing ethics, but with a topic focused on learning as much as we can about the potential for both good and harm from generative AI (including large language models) and things we can do (mostly technically, but including policy) to mitigate the harms.</description>

      <description>Syllabus cs6501: Risks and Benefits of Generative AI and LLMs University of Virginia, Fall 2023
Meetings: Mondays and Wednesdays, 9:30-10:45am in Rice 340
Course Objective. This seminar will focus on understanding the potential risks and benefits of advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models. This is a research-focused seminar that will expect students to read papers and lead discussions.
Expected Background: Students are not required to have prior background in machine learing or security, but will be expected to learn whatever background they need on these topics mostly on their own.</description>

      <description>Here are some suggestions for how to create the class blog posts for your assigned classes.
I believe each team has at least a few members with enough experience using git and web contruction tools that following these instructions won&amp;rsquo;t be a big burden, but if you have other ways you want to build your blog page for a topic let me know and we can discuss alternative options.
Install Hugo.</description>
