<h3 id="definition-of-interpretability">Definition of Interpretability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Interpretability in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning refers to the <strong>extent to which a model&rsquo;s decisions, predictions, or internal workings can be understood and explained by humans</strong>. It&rsquo;s the degree to which a model&rsquo;s behavior can be made transparent, comprehensible, and meaningful to users, stakeholders, or domain experts.</li>
<li>In concept-based interpretability, the focus is on <strong>explaining the model&rsquo;s decisions in terms of high-level concepts or features</strong> that make sense to humans. This approach seeks to relate model behavior to intuitive, domain-specific, or abstract concepts. For example, in a medical diagnosis model, concept-based interpretability might explain that a decision was made because certain symptoms or biomarkers were present.</li>
<li>Mechanistic-based interpretability aims to provide a detailed understanding of how the model makes decisions. This approach delves into the <strong>inner workings of the model</strong>, explaining the role of individual features, weights, and computations. For instance, in a deep learning model, mechanistic interpretability might involve explaining the contributions of specific layers in the decision process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-is-interpretability-important">Why is interpretability important?</h3>
<p>Interpretability is important because it builds trust, aids in debugging, and is essential in applications where the consequences of AI decisions are significant, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn how the model makes the decision.</li>
<li>Analyze whether there are biases or shortcuts that a model is taking during application.</li>
<li>When dealing with human-in-the-loop systems, interpretability enables humans to work collaboratively with AI, leveraging their complementary strengths to achieve better outcomes.</li>
</ol>

While the vanilla gradient method output is noisy, the other methods “improve” the map visually, and we can thus gradually see a ‘clearer’ pixel-level attribution influence which aligns with human understanding of the concept ‘bird’. It’s also important to note that none of these methods was evaluated in a quantitative way. It is also important to consider how much ones that incorporate the input directly are actually explaining the model.</p>

    <p>Example: given an image and text prediction provided by the model, a saliency map highlights the most important features or regions within the image that the model uses to make decisions.</p>
    <p>These maps can help users understand the model's decision-making process, particularly in applications such as medical imaging or self-driving cars. To create the saliency map, randomly crop or mask parts of the image and compute the similarity between the cropped images and text. If the similarity value is positive, indicating the crop is closer to the query, it should be represented as a red region on the saliency map. Conversely, if the value is negative, it should be depicted as a blue region.</p>

    <p>Attention plays a pivotal role in numerous applications, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). For instance, the choice of a specific word, along with the assigned weight, signifies a correlation between that weight and the decision made.</p>
    <p>In NLP, understanding which words or elements are emphasized, and to what extent (indicated by their respective weights), is crucial. This emphasis often sheds light on the correlation between the input data and the model's decision-making process. Attention-based explainers serve as valuable tools in dissecting and interpreting these correlations, offering insights into how decisions are derived in NLP models.</p>

    <p>A recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10186.pdf">study</a> has cautioned against using attention weights to highlight input tokens “responsible for” model outputs and constructing just-so stories on this basis.

    <p>If attention was a necessary component for good performance, we would expect a large drop between the two rightmost columns (i.e. comparison of model with trained attention weights and frozen uniform attention weights). Somewhat surprisingly (although less surprising when one considers the evaluated tasks), for three of the classiﬁcation tasks the attention layer appears to offer little to no improvement whatsoever. In these cases, the accuracies are near identical on 3 out of 5 datasets, and so attention plays no role in explanations if we don’t need it in our prediction.</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p><img src="../images/week9/day1-slides-21.png" alt="discussion"></p>
<p>Group 1: Human interpretability features are essential. For instance, in the application of AI in drug design, an AI model alters a molecule from a non-drug variant to its drug counterpart. Presently, the predominant approach involves creating a black-box model that transforms one molecule into its drug form, contributing to a lack of credibility in the process. For example, a doctor unfamiliar with deep learning cannot comprehend the inner workings of the model that facilitates the conversion of regular molecules into drugs, making it challenging to ensure the safety, efficacy, and trustworthiness of the AI-driven drug design without transparent and interpretable models.</p>
<p>Group 2: A general observation we&rsquo;ve noted is that the requirements or metrics for Explainable AI (XAI) significantly depend on the intended purpose of the tool. For instance, the explanations provided for AI researchers and end users are likely to differ due to their distinct focuses. On the other hand, there is a risk of amplifying confirmation bias if we anticipate XAI to explain phenomena in alignment with human beliefs. To truly understand why a model performs effectively, it might be necessary to set aside human biases and preconceived notions, enabling an unbiased exploration of how the model achieves its performance.</p>
<p>Group 3: Currently, there are still lots of difficulties and problems in using XAI tools in general. For example, methods such as LIME and SHAP always need a lot computation and don’t work well on complex large models. Besides, we lack ground-truth explanations and therefore, we don’t know whether the learned explanations are useful or not. Our suggestions for solving those problems and also issues mentioned by other groups are: 1) Approximating the complicate model to some simple model 2) Build self-explainable models 3) Combine different metrics and XAI tools.</p>

    <p>The critical point here underscores the necessity of task-specific techniques, which may seem self-explanatory—how can general principles apply without a specific context? Even then, this assumption is not necessarily guaranteed.</p>
    <p>One of the primary challenges between the current state of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and potentially valuable XAI methods is the absence of a method-task link. Ensuring the usability and reliability of an explanation in a particular task requires a deeper connection. This could either involve anchoring explanations in theory directly aligned with the task's requirements or creating task-inspired explanations and subsequently empirically evaluating them within the targeted application.</p>

There are several ways SoLU is designed to reduce polysemanticity:
    <ul>
        <li>Lateral inhibition, approximate sparsity and superlinearity can be achieved by changing the MLP activation function.</li>
        <li>Instead of sigmoid in GeLU, they use softmax, and drop the constant (1.7).</li>
        <li>However, this led to a massive drop in performance, so they added an extra LayerNorm after SoLU.</li>
        <li>The intuition was that it might fix issues with activation scale and improve optimization.</li>
        <li>However, the authors admit that one reason for the performance improvement may be that the extra LayerNorm may allow superposition to be smuggled through in smaller activations.</li>

    <p>When SoLU is applied on a vector of large and small values (4, 1, 4, 1), the large values will suppress smaller values. Large basis aligned vectors e.g. (4, 0, 0, 0) are preserved. A feature spread across many dimensions (1, 1, 1, 1) will be suppressed to a smaller magnitude.

    <p>Although performance on overall tasks tends to align with the training set's general performance, it's important to note that this may not reveal shortcomings in specific tasks or areas. To ensure a comprehensive understanding, the researchers conducted various evaluations on representative tasks, corroborating the insights gained from the loss curves.</p>
    <p>They assessed their model's performance on a variety of datasets, including Lambada, OpenBookQA, ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, TriviaQA, and arithmetic datasets, and the results are displayed in Figure 2. The authors observed that, overall, there were similar performance levels between the baseline and SoLU models across different model sizes. However, they did notice notable differences in a couple of tasks. For example, the SoLU model performed better on arithmetic tasks, while the baseline model outperformed on TriviaQA.

This made it easy for the evaluators to quickly go through the snippets and spot any common themes. You can see an example of what these evaluators saw in the figure. (Note that this experiment includes no control &mdash; humans are prone to finding patterns in randomness also.)</p>

    <p>This shows the results of human experiments on interpretability of neurons in SoLU vs baseline transformer for various model sizes. The authors used transformers with different numbers of layers, from 1 to 64. The blue line shows the proportion of neurons in the baseline transformer that were marked as potentially having a clear interpretation across these different layer counts. The red line shows the same thing for the SoLU transformer. The green dot specifically represents the proportion of interpretable neurons in the 16-layer model that had an extra layer-norm but not SoLU. In general, for models with 1 to 40 layers, using SoLU increased the number of neurons that could be easily understood by about 25%. However, in the 64-layer model, the improvement was much smaller.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this paper is to clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of a sparse autoencoder in achieving two main objectives: extracting understandable features from superposition and facilitating basic circuit analysis. Specifically, the authors achieve this by using a one-layer transformer with a 512-neuron MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) layer. They break down the activations of the MLP into features that are relatively easy to interpret by training sparse autoencoders on the MLP activations obtained from a massive dataset comprising 8 billion data points. These autoencoders have varying expansion factors, ranging from 1×(resulting in 512 features) to 256×(resulting in 131,072 features).</p>

    <p>Sparse autoencoders use several techniques and strategies to extract interpretable features from neural network activations:
      <ol>
        <li>MSE Loss for Avoiding Polysemanticity: Emphasizes using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss instead of cross-entropy loss to prevent the overloading of features.</li>
        <li>Larger Internal Dimension: Advocates for a larger number of internal features within the autoencoder to create an overcomplete set of features.</li>
        <li>L1 Penalty: Applies an L1 penalty on the internal features to encourage sparsity within the representation.</li>
        <li>Input Bias: Introduces an approach of adding an input bias to the representations in autoencoders, which demonstrates a significant boost in performance for the models used in toy examples.</li>

<p>The purpose of sparse autoencoders is to extract meaningful features from neural network activations. To avhice a good decomposition, where the features extracted should be interpretable and able to describe the activations&rsquo; context requires the ability to describe activations, interpret downstream effects of changes, and cover a significant portion of functionality within the data.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Activation Sampling Bias</strong>: In previous evaluations, there was a bias due to just considering the top-activation neurons which might inaccurately appear monosemantic due to their higher activations. To mitigate this bias, the approach involves sampling uniformly across all possible activations for each given feature.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Interpretable Features:</strong> The authors used an evaluation process where human-based assessments are used to determine the interpretability of the features extracted. The criteria for interpretability are based on the authors&rsquo; distributed-based evaluation, where a score above eight is considered sufficiently interpretable.</p>

<p>The sparse autoencoder technique in focus can explain up to 80% of the loss. This means that by replacing activated neurons with reconstructions, 80% of the original model&rsquo;s loss can be accounted for without altering the model. Notably, there is a high correlation (Spearman correlation around 0.7) between independent features of two models sharing the same architecture but having different random initializations.</p>
<p>Considering these evaluation findings, the class divided into three groups to discuss specific questions related to the interpretability of features.</p>
<p>One group noted a common discrepancy between the expectations from
language models and humans. Language models are often expected to
perform at superhuman or domain expert levels, while their
capabilities might align more closely with those of a standard
human. The use of a general-purpose language model for features
requiring domain expertise was seen as a potential issue, as the
model&rsquo;s interpretation might lack the required domain-specific
knowledge.</p>
<p>The group also shared their discussion about the possibility that
language models might &lsquo;hallucinate&rsquo; interpretations for given
features, possibly creating false correlations or interpretations that
do not necessarily exist within the data. Human evaluators might also
introduce subconscious biases or look for patterns without having the
necessary domain expertise, potentially affecting the interpretability
findings. Another key point they raised was about the intended
audience for interpretability. They discussed that interpretability
work from the language models might primarily target researchers,
specifically computer science researchers who are involved in
developing and assessing models, rather than end-users of these models
in practical applications.</p>
<p>The second group highlighted the multifaceted nature of the variance
observed in models designed to find interpretable features. It
primarily attributed this variability to stochastic elements in the
learning process, the order and sequence of data during training, and
the diverse interpretations resulting from these variations, which may
lead to equally interpretable yet different feature sets.</p>
<p>The final group emphasized the potential acceptability of the unexplained 20% in certain contexts, underscoring the value in correctly interpreting the majority of the content. Additionally, they noted the potential nuances within the unexplained portion, distinguishing between varying reasons for lack of interpretability within that portion.</p>

The training of three different versions of autoencoders with increasing sizes of the internal representation were described, leading to more sparsity in interpretable features. They analogized a dictionary learning algorithm to an unlimited number of interpretable features, Even with varied model semantics, a structured superposition of concepts emerges in the learning process. 
<p>By feature clustering and splitting, this splitting of features leads to more fine-grained interpretations, where a single concept or feature might bifurcate into multiple similar but distinct interpretable features. These findings may have benefits beyond one-layer transformers, suggesting the possibility of applying this technique to larger transformers or models.</p>

The summary underscores the potential and limitations of both architectural changes aimed at controlling polysemanticity and the potential for post-learning techniques, but so far only partially demonstrated for a simple  1-layer transformer. 
<p>Post-learning interpretation seems more practical for now than
adapting existing training techniques for interpretability, which would require larger changes to current practices.</p> </td> </table></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>(Softmax Linear Units) Elhage et al. present the Superposition Hypothesis which argues that networks attempt to learn more features than the number of neurons in the networks. By delegating multiple features to a single node, interpreting the significance of the node becomes challenging. Do you believe this hypothesis based upon their explanation, or do you suspect there is some separate obstacle here, such as the counter-argument that nodes could represent standalone features that are difficult to infer but often obvious once discovered?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Softmax Linear Units) Do you see any difference between SLU and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ELU.html">ELU</a> coupled with batch-norm/layer-norm? How does this relate to the reasons the LLM community shifted from ReLU (or variants like ELU) to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415">GeLU</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Towards Monosemanticity) Could the identification of these “interpretable” features could enable training (via distillation, or other ways) smaller models that still preserve interpretability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Towards Monosemanticity) Toying around with <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/vis/a1.html?ordering=count">visualization</a> seems to show a good identification of relevant positive tokens for concepts, but negative concepts do not seem to be very insightful. Try the explorer out for a few concepts and see if these observations align with what you see. What do you think might be happening here? Can it possibly be solved by changing the auto-encoder training pipeline, or possibly by involving structural changes like SLU? Are there other interesting elements or patterns you see?</p>
